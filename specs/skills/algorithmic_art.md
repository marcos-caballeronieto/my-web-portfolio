# Generative Art Protocol
- **Constraint**: All visuals must be pure code. No external image dependencies.
- **Reproducibility**: Use a `GlobalSeed` variable defined in `REQUIREMENTS.md` to ensure consistent art generation across builds.
- **Performance**: All canvas operations must be optimized. Use `noStroke()` and `fill()` instead of drawing individual lines when possible. Avoid unnecessary `redraw()` calls.
